## About

Just a little react project to refresh fundamental ideas that might have been rusty.
Site creates cards for users based off of https://jsonplaceholder.cypress.io/users.
Uses https://robohash.org/ to create robot images for the users.
Lastly there's a search box to filter the robots displayed.
